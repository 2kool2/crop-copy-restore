  <h2>Examples</h2>

  <h3>Single line crop</h3>

  <div class=txt data-cropCopyRestore>My wife Maria, loves hot spicy food. I found this out on our first date. She said “I really fancy a curry”. Well, I was keen to impress so I said, “great, that’s my favourite too ”But it isn’t, never has been. We’ve been married 15 years and I still haven’t
    let on. Don’t know why. But whenever I cook her favourite chicken gujarati extra spicy, with green beans and fresh ginger, I do what any self-respecting chef would do. I cheat. I put a king size spoonful of natural yoghurt in mine. And I keep schtum.</div>


  <h3>Three lines</h3>

  <div class=txt data-cropCopyRestore=3>Sometimes, it's the undemandingly easy, everyday, recipes that deliver the most joy. For 'Iain' and his dad, from our Food Love Story, it's croque monsieur – they first had it on a joint trip to France, and since then it's become their favourite weekend
    lunch. Iain's made a few changes to it along the way (bonjour, wafer thin roast turkey) – but for him and his dad, it's most definitely 'proper'.</div>


  <h3>Two lines</h3>

  <div class=txt data-cropCopyRestore=2>Any parent will probably be able to relate to 'Sunita' in our Food Love Story. Kids can be champion fussy eaters, especially when it comes to vegetables. Here's a genius solution – meatballs packed with under-the-radar veg. Sunita's kids love them, and are none the wiser.</div>
